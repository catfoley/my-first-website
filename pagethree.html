	<p><strong>Tips for Cooking with Kids</strong></p>
<p>There's nothing better than creating a tasty meal or dessert with your kids - and there's nothing more disappointing when you lose their attention or interest and end up making it yourself (after they've messed up every inch of the kitchen!) So when I cook or bake with young kids, I make sure to use recipes with just a few steps or a few ingredients.  That way I know I can keep them involved from beginning to end!</p>

	<p><strong>How to Begin</strong/></p>
	
<p>We try to be healthy with what we eat (until it's time for dessert). So start with some easy veggies. Buy the already peeled carrots or Brussel sprouts or broccoli and pour them straight onto a baking sheet. Have your child pour a little olive oil, salt and pepper over the veggies and then spread out on a tray. Cook for 20 minutes at 400 and they already have an easy, tasty veggie!  Once they master roasting veggies, have one baking tray with cut up red peppers, cherry tomatoes, 1/4 cup olive oil and salt. If they like a smoky flavor, and a pepper from a can of adobo chiles. On another pan, pour out two packages of potato gnocchi, coated in olive oil and salt. Bake both trays at 400 for 25-30 minutes, and then combine. Now they've made an easy, delicious entree (from NYT cooking). For a healthy dessert, take two bananas (from the freezer!) and put in a blender. Add a little bit of oat milk and vanilla and blend until smooth. We call it "nice" cream and your kids will love it!  You can serve it with the easy cookies, below. </div>
