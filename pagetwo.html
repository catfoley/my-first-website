<p>Are you looking for a fun, easy day trip with your kids?  Check out Bardstown, Kentucky, location of Federal Hill (My Old Kentucky Home)</p>
<div>
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I think our state song, My Old Kentucky Home, has the prettiest melody of all the state songs. It was written by Stephen Foster, who was inspired when he visited his cousin John Rowan's mansion in Nelson County. At the time - 1853 - Bardstown was one of Kentucky's most cultured cities, and Rowan's home and farm were busy and beautiful. Be sure to take a tour of Federal Hill to learn the history of the Rowan family and of our state song.</p>

<p>There's so much to do in Bardstown! Adults will be interested to know that it's the bourbon capital of the world. It's a key part of Kentucky's bourbon trail. You can stroll Bardstown's beautiful downtown area, and stop for tea and pastries or a nice big lunch. </div>
