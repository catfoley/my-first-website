<p>We love our summers!  I’ll share some tips here, as a teacher and as a mom, for how to have the most fun (but also productive!) summer yet.  And I’d love to hear ideas from you too!</p>
<div>
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I've just completed my 10th year of teaching Language Arts and Social Studies at Kit Carson. I've taught 5th and 4th grades. Reading and History are both passions of mine, so I find myself reading a lot of nonfiction, especially biographies.  I was a History major at Georgetown University - a long, long time ago! I grew up just outside of Washington, D.C. Sometimes my parents would wake up my brother, sister and me, and take us to see the monuments late at night, when everything was lit up. It was beautiful! These days you can't park right at the national monuments and run around them in your pajamas, but I have very fond memories of doing that, and maybe that's one reason I love history so much! My son (25, working at Vanderbilt University) and twin daughters (seniors at Georgetown University) share my love of history and the arts. Our favorite thing to do is explore new cities in new countries and get a feel for what their culture is like. I think our favorite culture so far is Spain's, where the focus is on working hard, playing harder, enjoying food, and taking an afternoon nap!</p>

	<p><strong>Summer Suggestions</strong/></p>
	
<p>Of course being outside, especially at the pool, is the best part of summer.  But what happens when it's too hot, or it's a rainy day? Reading at least one book a day with your kids is the BEST! You can read a book about horses, and then take a tour of our very own Kentucky Horse Park.  Or how about reading a book about President Lincoln, and taking a field trip to the Mary Todd Lincoln House in Lexington? My kids and I even planned rainy day field trips (must call ahead of time) for tours of the Post Office, Kroger, and even the local sewage treatment plant (they'll NEVER forget that one). </div>
